    <h1>ðŸ¥ž Pancakes</h1>
    <p>A pancake (or hotcake, griddlecake, or flapjack, not to be confused with oat bar flapjacks) is a flat cake, often thin
    and round, prepared from a starch-based batter that may contain eggs, milk and butter and cooked on a hot surface such
    as a griddle or frying pan, often frying with oil or butter. Archaeological evidence suggests that pancakes were
    probably the earliest and most widespread cereal food eaten in prehistoric societies.</p>
